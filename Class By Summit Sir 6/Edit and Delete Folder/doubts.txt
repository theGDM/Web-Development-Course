Q) on first editing and while deleting the same folder, we get confirmation message before deleting, but that have
   the name of previous fileName, not the latest one!
Ans: This is because, the inner function which is callback function of addEvenListner invoked on spanDelete will
make closure on fNmae which is the outer function

Q) How we are deleting the folder?
Ans: We are actually ataching delete function on every spanDelete of folder after creating them.
